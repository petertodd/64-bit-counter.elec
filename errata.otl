[_] 0% Errata for v1.0 pcb spin
	[_] Replace all Y5V 0.1uF's with X7R's
	[_] 0% Backup caps
		[_] Add 0.1ohm resistor in series with backup caps
		[_] Double to 600uF
	[_] Update LED LDO resistors
		: R101 - 169ohm
		: R102 - 330ohm
		:
		: Both should be 1%
	[_] RA4 should power the POT rather than go to the dip switch
		: This would help the PIC conserve power during the crash eeprom
		: write.
